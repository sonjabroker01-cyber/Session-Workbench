# Privacy-Isolated Networking Workbench

*A transparent, session-isolated environment for studying tracking, correlation, and network behavior.*

This project is designed for authorized security and privacy research and is not intended to provide anonymity or evade lawful investigation.

---

---

## Overview

Privacy-Isolated Networking Workbench is a research-grade desktop application designed
for penetration testers, cybersecurity professionals, and privacy researchers.

The project provides **session-based isolation, network origin shielding, and
fingerprint surface reduction** to help users study tracking, correlation, and
network behavior in a controlled and transparent way.

This project is **not designed to provide anonymity**, nor is it intended to evade
lawful investigation or bypass safeguards.

---

## Intended Audience

This software is intended for:

- Penetration testers
- Cybersecurity professionals
- Privacy and tracking researchers
- Journalists and analysts
- Developers testing network or geographic behavior

Use is limited to systems and networks you own or are explicitly authorized to test.

## Design Philosophy

The workbench is built around the following principles:

- **Session isolation over identity mutation**
- **Transparency over stealth**
- **Manual control over automation**
- **Correlation resistance over anonymity**
- **Lawful traceability preserved**

All identity and network characteristics are **stable within a session** and
**destroyed when the session ends**. Any change requires an explicit session restart.

## What This Project Is

- A session-isolated networking workbench
- A defensive privacy and research tool
- A transparent environment for observing system state
- A platform for studying tracking and correlation behavior

---

## What This Project Is Not

This project is intentionally **not**:

- An anonymity tool
- An evasion or stealth platform
- A fraud or automation framework
- A ban-evasion or account-creation tool
- A safeguard or KYC bypass system
- A consumer VPN replacement

No automation, scripting, or per-request identity rotation is provided.

## Traceability and Legal Position

This software does not log browsing activity, URLs, content, or credentials.

However:

- Network traffic may traverse third-party infrastructure
- Lawful attribution may exist at upstream providers
- Attribution may be obtained through subpoena, warrant, or other legal process

This project does **not** attempt to defeat lawful investigations.
