# Traceability Model

## Overview
The system is correlation-resistant, not attribution-proof.

## What Is Hidden
- User IP from destination sites
- DNS queries from ISP
- Persistent browser identifiers

## What Is Preserved
- Lawful attribution at VPN or proxy providers
- Payment and account records (outside application scope)

## Legal Boundary
Tracing a user requires lawful process such as a subpoena or warrant
directed at upstream infrastructure providers.
