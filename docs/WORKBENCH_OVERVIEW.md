# Networking Workbench Overview

The Privacy-Isolated Networking Workbench is designed as a controlled environment
for observing, testing, and validating privacy and tracking behavior on the web.

The workbench exposes system state intentionally, allowing professionals to
understand exactly how identity, network routing, and fingerprint surfaces
behave during a session.

This is not a consumer anonymity product. It is a professional research tool.
