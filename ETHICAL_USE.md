# Ethical Use Policy

## Purpose
This project is intended to support ethical, lawful, and authorized use cases
in the areas of privacy research, cybersecurity testing, and defensive analysis.

Ethical use is a core design principle, not an afterthought.

## Acceptable Use
Acceptable uses include:
- Authorized penetration testing
- Privacy and tracking research
- Security education and training
- Journalism and source protection
- Network and application testing on owned or permitted systems

## Authorization Requirement
You must have explicit authorization before using this software on systems,
networks, or services you do not own.

Lack of enforcement by a target does not imply authorization.

- Engage in illegal activity
- Evade law enforcement or legal process
- Bypass safeguards, access controls, or platform protections

## Transparency and Accountability
Users are expected to:
- Understand the software’s limitations
- Accept that lawful attribution may exist
- Take responsibility for their actions
- Avoid deceptive or harmful behavior

## Ethical Principle
This software is designed to:
- Reduce unnecessary exposure
- Support informed testing and research
- Encourage responsible privacy practices

It is not designed to eliminate accountability or enable wrongdoing.

## Enforcement
Project maintainers reserve the right to:
- Reject contributions that conflict with ethical use
- Remove content promoting misuse
- Distance the project from unethical applications

Ethical use is essential to the continued availability and legitimacy of this project.
