## What We Will Not Accept

Pull requests will not be accepted if they introduce:

- Automation or scripting intended to scale actions
- Fingerprint randomization or impersonation of real users/devices
- Platform-specific or service-specific modes
- Functionality designed to evade detection or attribution
- Claims of anonymity, invisibility, or untraceability

---

## Code Style & Quality

- Prefer clarity over cleverness
- Comment intent, not obvious syntax
- Avoid unnecessary dependencies
- UI changes should prioritize readability and transparency

## Final Note

Session-Workbench is intentionally conservative in scope.
If you are unsure whether a change aligns with the project’s goals, open an issue first
and describe the idea before implementing it.

Thank you for helping keep the project focused, safe, and useful.
