# Privacy-Isolated Networking Workbench
## Technical and Legal Whitepaper

### Executive Summary
This application provides correlation-resistant browsing through strict session
isolation, identity normalization, and controlled network routing.

It is intentionally designed to prevent abuse, automation, and evasion while
remaining useful for authorized security testing and privacy research.

### Design Intent
- Reduce passive surveillance
- Prevent cross-session correlation
- Preserve lawful attribution
- Provide transparent system behavior

### Non-Goals
- Absolute anonymity
- Undetectability
- Identity forgery
- Safeguard bypass

### Intended Use
This tool is intended for use on systems and networks owned by the user or where
explicit authorization has been granted.

### Guiding Principle
Stable within a session. Disposable across sessions. Never invisible to lawful process.
